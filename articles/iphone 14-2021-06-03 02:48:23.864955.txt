    "Article": "Given that we\u2019re already on the 14th iteration of iOS, there\u2019s a good chance that Apple\u2019s mobile OS is teeming with hidden and useful features that you had no idea existed. Hardly a surprise, Apple for whatever reason doesn\u2019t always advertise some of the more useful features in iOS and, instead, leaves it to reviewers and users to discover on their own.\n\nWell, we decided to make things a bit easier for you and compile some of the best iOS 14 features lurking in the shadows. Whether you\u2019re a new iPhone convert or a seasoned user, there\u2019s a strong chance you\u2019ll find something surprising and useful in the list below.\n\nChange the default email and browser apps\n\nWith iOS 14, Apple for the first time made it possible for users to change the default browser and mail apps on their devices. So if you\u2019re not a fan of mobile Safari or Apple\u2019s standard mail client, you\u2019ll definitely want to take advantage of this new functionality.\n\nIf, for example, you want to make Chrome your default browser, all you have to do is go to Settings > Chrome and then select the \u201cDefault Browser App\u201d setting. From there, you can specifically select Chrome and be on your way.\n\nIf you want to change your default email app, you can follow the same instructions by opening up Settings and then scrolling all the way down to your preferred third-party email client, and then selecting the Default Email App option.\n\nHide unused apps\n\nIf there\u2019s an app you rarely use but don\u2019t want to get rid of entirely, there\u2019s a way you can hide it as opposed to deleting it. This is a pretty nifty tip for apps you only use every once in a blue moon, like travel or hotel apps, for example.\n\nTo take advantage of this, long-press the app you want to hide and you\u2019ll see an option that says Remove App at the bottom of a pop-up window. If you select that, you should see an option to either \u201cDelete App\u201d or \u201cMove to App Library.\u201d If you select the latter, the app will be magically removed.\n\nIf you want to access any apps in the App Library, all you have to do is swipe to your last page of apps and then swipe to the left one more time whereupon they will all appear. App Library apps can also be accessed via search.\n\nStory continues\n\nTap your iPhone to trigger pre-determined actions\n\nWith iOS 14, Apple implemented a new Back Tap feature that is buried within the Accessibility settings. With the Back Tap feature, users can either double or triple tap the back of their device and, in turn, trigger certain functions like taking a screenshot, muting your device, viewing the Notification Center, activating Siri, adjusting the volume, and more.\n\nThe feature was designed for people with special accessibility needs but should prove to be useful for all users.\n\nTo turn this feature on, go to Settings and then open up the Accessibility preferences. Next, scroll all the way down to the \u201cPhysical and Motor\u201d heading and select \u201cTouch.\u201d Following that, scroll down even further and hit the \u201cBack Tap\u201d option.\n\nFrom there, you\u2019ll be able to set if you want to activate Back Tap with either a double or triple tap. And, of course, you\u2019ll also be able to designate what action you\u2019d like to be triggered when you call the Back Tap feature into action.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Back Tap feature should still work well with most cases.\n\nMake sure the audio level of your headphones is safe\n\niOS 14 includes a clever way to ensure that the volume of your headphones is at a safe level. To get started, open up the Settings app and then scroll down to and select Control Center. From there, tap the green \u201cplus\u201d icon next to the Hearing setting. This will add a Hearing icon to the Control Center next time you pull it up.\n\nThe next time you\u2019re listening to music or a podcast, bring up Control Center and you\u2019ll see audio levels next to the Hearing icon. If the audio level is green, you\u2019re within a safe limit. If the audio level is yellow, you\u2019ll see an exclamation mark gently prodding you to turn down the volume a bit.\n\nEven better, you can tap the Hearing icon from within the Control Center whereupon you\u2019ll be able to see the exact decibel level from your headphones.\n\nPin a text conversation for easy access\n\nApple has a long way to go if it wants to make Messages as capable as WhatsApp, which is the rumor. That said, Apple with iOS 14 Apple did start adding some nice power-user features to its messaging app.\n\nAs a prime example, iOS 14 makes it easy for you to pin a text message conversation at the top of the messages app for easy access. To do so, all you have to do is open up Messages and then find the conversation you\u2019d like to pin. Next, long-press on the recipient\u2019s name and you\u2019ll see an option to Pin the name. Now when you open up the Messages app, that particular conversation will remain at the top.\n\nGet notified when someone mentions your name in a group message\n\nIf there\u2019s a big group chat that you\u2019ve either muted or are half-heartedly paying attention to, there\u2019s a way to ensure that you get notified anytime someone mentions your name.\n\nTo activate this feature, simply go to Settings > Messages and then select the \u201cNotify Me\u201d toggle. As detailed, this option, when turned on, will notify you \u201cwhen your name is mentioned even if conversations are muted.\u201d\n\nToday's Top Deals\n\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com"
