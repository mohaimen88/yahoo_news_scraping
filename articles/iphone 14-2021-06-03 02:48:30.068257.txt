    "Article": "Good design isn\u2019t limited to expensive laptops, but the best design is certainly found on higher-end ones (Independent)\n\nDo you need an expensive laptop? After all, you can buy a usable one for a couple of hundred pounds, can\u2019t you? Well, yes, but sometimes one wants more than usable.\n\nA pricier laptop has a lot going for it. The processor will be faster, there\u2019ll be more active memory and SSD storage, for a start.\n\nAll of which means the laptop will go faster, not pause endlessly while doing the most mundane of tasks. If your laptop does that, you may be wishing you\u2019d spent a bit more, after all.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the processor that will be better on a pricier machine. The screen, keyboard, speakers and build quality will be better on a high-end computer.\n\nOh, and if you use software that makes heavy demands, such as video editing, then you need something with a bit more poke.\n\nGood design isn\u2019t limited to expensive laptops, but the best design is certainly found on higher-end ones. So are displays that go to the edge of the device, super-slim builds and top-flight materials.\n\nThere are three operating systems to choose from, Windows, which has the most mainstream programs, Google Chrome and macOS, which is only found on Apple\u2019s computers. The newest MacBook Pro and MacBook use a new processor which means many iPhone and iPad apps will work on the Mac screens, too.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

But the new version is the first to use Apple\u2019s own silicon instead of an Intel processor. The M1 chip is breathtakingly fast, so that everything, from the instant-on display, to when you open the laptop\u2019s lid, is amazingly speedy. The magic keyboard, as Apple calls it, is dreamy to use, responsive and comfortable with plenty of travel to make it feel good. The latest macOS software is bright and appealing while remaining as intuitive and accessible as ever. There are other neat features such as a fingerprint sensor in the power button to make it secure and a huge trackpad. The processor is the real standout, though. It\u2019s so strong that many who have previously sought out the pricier MacBook Pro will find this more than powerful enough for their needs. The extra power has not diminished the Air\u2019s great battery life, however, as this model has six more hours\u2019 usability than the previous model.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuy now \u00a3999.00, Apple\n\nHuawei MateBook X Pro 2020\n\nOperating system: Windows 10\n\nStorage: 512GB\n\nRAM: 16GB\n\nProcessor: Intel Core i5\n\nDisplay size: 13.9in\n\nTouchscreen: Yes\n\nHuawei\u2019s latest laptop is powerful and attractively designed. It\u2019s also great value. The display has especially narrow bezels, so it looks good and means there\u2019s a 13.9in screen in a laptop barely any bigger than the MacBook Air. There\u2019s no camera on the screen, which saves space. Instead, it\u2019s hidden under the central key of the keyboard top row. Press it and the camera pops up. Neat Huawei extras include Huawei Share: tap a Huawei phone on the computer and phone\u2019s contents appear on the laptop\u2019s display. It\u2019s slim and reasonably light, with a powerful charger to recharge quickly, though the battery life is good for 11 hours.\n\nBuy now \u00a3799.99, Huawei\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 3\n\nOperating system: Windows 10\n\nStorage: 128GB\n\nRAM: 8GB\n\nProcessor: Intel Core i5\n\nDisplay size: 13.5in\n\nTouchscreen: Yes\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s own-brand hardware is extremely good, with great build quality and durability. There are five colours to choose from (sandstone is particularly cool-looking) and some come with a different surface material, alcantara, to add to the comfort level. The design has a slightly angular, slim profile but still includes a full USB-A socket where many rivals plump for the smaller USB-C (there\u2019s one of those, too). The benefit of USB-A is lots of older products will attach to it. The high-resolution 13.5in display looks great, and it\u2019s available with a larger, 15in display if you prefer. Good, but not exceptional, battery life.\n\nBuy now \u00a3849.00, Microsoft\n\nGoogle Pixelbook Go\n\nOperating system: Chrome OS\n\nStorage: 64GB\n\nRAM: 8GB\n\nProcessor: Intel Core m3\n\nDisplay size: 13.3in\n\nTouchscreen: Yes\n\nThis is about the classiest Chrome laptop around, with a neat magnesium casing that feels great to the touch. The operating system is keyed into Google and works best when it\u2019s connected to the internet, though there is no longer the need for it to be connected continuously, as there was when Chromebooks launched. The keyboard is especially pleasing because it\u2019s so quiet and battery life is very strong. It also recharges fast: a 20-minute top-up gives two hours of usage. Prices start from \u00a3629, but configurations top out at a model that costs \u00a31,329, which is the fastest and most capable, of course.\n\nBuy now \u00a3629.00, Google\n\nApple MacBook Pro 13in\n\nOperating system: macOS Big Sur\n\nStorage: 256GB\n\nRAM: 8GB\n\nProcessor: Apple M1\n\nDisplay size: 13.3in\n\nTouchscreen: No\n\nLike the MacBook Air, this laptop has the brand-new, super-fast Apple-made M1 chip at its centre. As it\u2019s the same as in the more affordable MacBook Air, why would you choose this model instead? For the most demanding users, there are benefits to the Pro. Unlike the Air, there is a fan in this model which means the fast performance can continue for even longer. Additionally, the entry-level Pro includes a slightly more powerful graphics chip. There are other benefits: the top row of function keys is replaced by a narrow touchscreen so the functions change according to whether you\u2019re using a word processor or photo editor, for instance. Like the Air, the power button has a fingerprint sensor in it, the keyboard is supremely comfortable and the trackpad is huge and very responsive.\n\nBuy now \u00a31299.00, Apple\n\nHP Spectre x360 13-aw0114na\n\nOperating system: Windows 10\n\nStorage: 256GB\n\nRAM: 8GB\n\nProcessor: Intel Core i5\n\nDisplay size: 13.3in\n\nTouchscreen: Yes\n\nThe design is really eye-catching, with corners that are angled and include sockets tucked away in them. Anti-reflection display makes the nearly borderless screen easier to see. This is a convertible laptop which means that you can use it in conventional fashion, as a tablet, or even standing the display up in \u201ctent mode\u201d which is great for watching video or scribbling on the display with the supplied stylus. The \u201cposeidon blue\u201d finish looks brilliant and every part of the styling, down to the hinges, is excellent.\n\nBuy now \u00a31199.95, Amazon\n\nHuawei MateBook 14\n\nOperating system: Windows 10\n\nStorage: 512GB\n\nRAM: 16GB\n\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 7\n\nDisplay size: 14in\n\nTouchscreen:Yes\n\nThe high-resolution display on the MateBook 14 looks sensational and has an impressively narrow bezel around it. This means that, like the MateBook X Pro above, the webcam we\u2019re all using so much at the moment for group video calls, is buried in the keyboard. Still the angle of view isn\u2019t too up-your-nose and the advantage is that when you press the key down you can be certain that the camera can\u2019t see you. Like the MateBook X Pro, this has Huawei Share to easily put an image of your Huawei handset screen on the laptop screen. It\u2019s also light, thin and very fast. A version with less storage, less RAM and a slower processor is also available, for \u00a3689.99.\n\nBuy now \u00a3799.99, Huawei Store\n\nDell XPS 15 9500\n\nOperating system: Windows 10\n\nStorage: 1TB\n\nRAM: 16GB\n\nProcessor: Intel Core i7-10750H\n\nDisplay size: 15.6in\n\nTouchscreen: No\n\nThe XPS 15 9500 is fast and powerful, with an attractive design and immersive 15.6in display which is particularly inviting for video games, though this is not a dedicated gaming laptop, it\u2019s much more versatile. The huge SSD storage (1TB) means there\u2019s plenty of space for all your files and programs. The display looks so good thanks to the narrow bezel all round and the XPS15 also has impressive audio thanks to great stereo speakers.\n\nBuy now \u00a31649.00, Currys PC World\n\nMicrosoft Surface Book 3\n\nOperating system: Windows 10\n\nStorage: 256GB\n\nRAM: 8GB\n\nProcessor: Intel i5\n\nDisplay size: 13.5in\n\nTouchscreen:Yes\n\nThe Surface Book 3 is a powerful, fully-featured laptop. However, if there are times when you only need a tablet, you can click a switch and remove the display, which is light and attractive. Even detached, this still offers full Windows software but as some of the processing power and the battery are in the keyboard side, you get the most out it when it\u2019s connected. The magnesium build makes the Surface Book light but robust, and the hinge between the two halves is a quiet masterpiece of design. Performance is fast and consistent.\n\nBuy now \u00a31325.00, Microsoft\n\nLenovo Yoga 5G\n\nOperating system: Windows 10\n\nStorage: 512GB\n\nRAM: 8GB\n\nProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx 5G\n\nDisplay size: 14in\n\nTouchscreen: Yes\n\nThis is the world\u2019s first 5G laptop, meaning you needn\u2019t worry about getting on to a wifi broadband network \u2013 which means your valuable data can\u2019t be compromised on a dodgy wifi connection. It also means you can use it outdoors, for instance. Because of the 5G sim in the laptop, you just connect to the EE network, the most advanced 5G network in the UK. It\u2019s sold by EE in the same way as a mobile phone would be: there\u2019s no upfront cost but instead a monthly charge of \u00a3112.50 for 24 months. This includes 80GB of data each month. The laptop looks great and is pretty light. Battery life is outstanding: up to 24 hours.\n\n\u00a3112.50 per month, EE\n\nBuy now \u00a31999.99, Lenovo\n\nThe Verdict: High-end laptops\n\nThe real combination of brains and beauty is the new Apple MacBook Air with the company\u2019s own silicon powering it, the M1 chip. But Windows users can turn to the Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 for a solid, impressive machine. And Huawei\u2019s MateBook 14 is great-looking and strong value.\n\nVoucher codes\n\nFor the latest discounts on laptops and other tech offers, try the links below:"
