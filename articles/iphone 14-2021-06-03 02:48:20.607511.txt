    "Article": "Before you install any iOS update, you can always click on the link in the description to see what new features are being added and what bugs or security issues are being addressed.\n\nQUESTION: Is there a way to tell if someone has hacked my iPhone and is spying on me?\n\nANSWER: Apple has always been focused on making the iPhone as secure as possible, and with the release of iOS 14, the options for controlling and monitoring what\u2019s happening with your phone have dramatically improved.\n\nDespite all of these security features, there are a couple of ways that someone can gain access to your iPhone for spying purposes.\n\nThe first would require them to have access to your iPhone while it was unlocked so they can install a remote access tool on it.\n\nHow iPhone could be accessed with an app\n\nDepending upon the tool they choose, they may need an extended amount of time with it to sneak an app in.\n\nIf you think that someone may have had access to your iPhone, do a thorough search through all of the apps on your device to see if there any apps you don\u2019t recognize.\n\nMost of the spy apps will use names that seem like regular apps like a calculator or a game, so any app you don\u2019t recognize should be examined and removed if you don\u2019t need it.\n\nOne of the best new features in iOS 14 is the \"recording indicator\" that will show you via a small dot above the battery icon if an app is currently accessing your camera (green) or microphone (orange).\n\nBringing up the Control Center will reveal which app is using either at the top, which can help you quickly identify a rogue app.\n\nSpying without accessing your iPhone\n\nIf your iPhone backs everything up to your iCloud account, then someone can spy on your activity by accessing your iCloud account from any web browser.\n\nThey would need your Apple ID username and password in order to do this, so if you know that a third party has that information, there are a few steps you should take.\n\nStart by changing the password to something that you\u2019ve never used before, especially if the person knows your other passwords.\n\nYou should also change your security questions to answers that aren\u2019t easily figured out. For instance, if you use the high school mascot question, make up a mascot instead of using what is a pretty easy thing to figure out by anyone that knows you.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost importantly, make sure you have two-factor authentication turned on for your Apple ID, which makes remote access impossible without them having your iPhone in their hands at the time.\n\nIf you don\u2019t care about using iCloud as a backup for your iPhone, you can turn it off to eliminate this form of spying altogether.\n\nIf you choose to do this, make sure you have another way to backup your iPhone first. You will also want to make an archive copy of what is stored in your iCloud account, then remove the content you want to protect.\n\nOther signs to watch for\n\nWhile there are ways for a skilled person to cover their tracks after compromising your device, there are often subtle indicators of a problem.\n\nThings like strange screen activity that occurs when you aren\u2019t using the phone, extremely slow startup or shutdown times, apps that suddenly shut down or a sudden spike in data usage can be indications of a compromised device.\n\nThe nuclear option\n\nIf none of these steps leave you feeling confident, you can take the extreme step to reset your iPhone to the factory settings, but that should only be done if you know that you have a good verified backup of everything you care about.\n\nKen Colburn is founder and CEO of Data Doctors Computer Services, datadoctors.com.
