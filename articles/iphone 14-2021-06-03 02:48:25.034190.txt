    "Article": "Lurking behind the scenes on the iPhone are a handful of hidden apps that you probably had no idea existed. And while you might be inclined to believe that any app Apple doesn\u2019t make conspicuous probably lacks any meaningful utility, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nWe\u2019ve highlighted a few of these hidden iPhone apps in the past, but Gadget Hacks recently compiled them into an informative and easy-to-digest list. I think it\u2019s fair to say that even seasoned iPhone users will be somewhat surprised at a few of the apps Apple has, for whatever reason, made somewhat tricky to find.\n\nCode Scanner\n\nThe first example is an app called Code Scanner. As the name subtly suggests, Code Scanner is a QR scanning app that is seemingly no different than the built-in QR scanning functionality of the Camera app. Code Scanner, though, does have a few benefits. Most notably, scanning a QR code with Code Scanner will open up a corresponding link immediately via an in-app browser. By sidestepping Safari, Code Scanner helps clear up some clutter to the extent that you won\u2019t have innumerable Safari tabs open with restaurant menus, for example.\n\nYou can add Code Scanner to the Control Center by going to Settings > Control Center > Customize Controls and then tapping the green \u201cplus\u201d icon alongside where it says \u201cCode Scanner.\u201d\n\nMagnifier\n\nNext up is a feature we originally highlighted all the way back in 2016 when it was introduced with iOS 10. Dubbed Magnifier, this app is an accessibility feature that allows users to zoom in on text or an object to a serious degree.\n\nThe feature can be enabled by going to Settings > Accessibility > Magnifier and toggling it on. Once enabled, you can activate the Magnifier by triple-clicking on the side button of either your iPhone or iPad. If you\u2019re naturally wondering why you can\u2019t just use the regular zoom feature on the Camera app, the zoom capability via Magnifier is significantly more capable.\n\nBack Tap\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd while we\u2019re on the topic, I wanted to highlight not an app but a hidden feature that is truly a game-changer. As we highlighted last month, Apple with iOS 14 introduced a Back Tap feature such that you can perform a specified action when tapping on the back of your iPhone either two or three times. Some of the specified actions include muting a call, activating Siri, viewing the Notification Center, taking a screenshot, and more.\n\nYou can take advantage of this feature by going to Settings > Accessibility > Touch > Physical and Motor. From there, scroll down and you\u2019ll be able to select \u201cBack Tap.\u201d Next, you can indicate if you want to use a Double or Triple tap to activate it and specify which action you\u2019d like to be triggered by the back tap.\n\nYou can read more about the other two hidden apps, which include Print Center and Field Test, over at Gadget Hacks. They\u2019re not as intriguing as the first three, but if you\u2019re keen on learning all the ins and out of your iPhone, you\u2019ll most definitely find it of interest.\n\nToday's Top Deals\n\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com"
